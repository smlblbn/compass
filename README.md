Predicting which team and player has the ball.

Within this project, the main goal is predicting the player who controls the ball at that second with the location of the players on the football pitch and average speed of that players. With this prediction, next possible move at that second can be predicted even if the real move is not successful. The system predicts the player who has the ball at that moment. After that prediction, it checks the possible pass and shoots options for him then, it gives the best option as output. LSTM network was used for implementing the model.
