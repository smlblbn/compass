Within this project, the main goal is to predict the player who controls the ball at any second with the location of the players on the football pitch and the average speed of these players. Using this prediction, the next possible pass can be predicted even if the real pass is not successful. After detecting the player who has the ball, the system detects the possible pass options of that player then, it gives the best option as output. LSTM network was used for implementing the model.
